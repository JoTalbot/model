# MEMORY — Hermes OS on arm-server-01 (server id srv-oci-arm-01)

Every claim below is tagged. **FACT** = measured on this host. **OBSERVATION** = seen at least
once, may be situational. **HYPOTHESIS** = plausible, unproven — never act on one as if it were
a FACT. **DECISION** = a choice that was made, with the reason. **LESSON** = a generalisation
from something that actually went wrong.

Do not add an entry without a tag. If you cannot say which tag applies, you do not know yet.

---

## 1. The machine

- **FACT** Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, kernel 6.17.0-1020-oracle, aarch64 (Neoverse-N1, 4 cores), 23 GiB
  RAM, root fs `/dev/sda1` 145G. Several hundred GB of other projects' data live here.
- **FACT** This is a *shared production* box: 35+ systemd services, ~20 containers, several live
  projects. Somebody else's uptime outranks your task.
- **FACT** Disk has been at 98% in the past. `df -h /` before any install, pull or build.
- **LESSON** A venv that dies at ENOSPC leaves a broken interpreter on PATH — worse than a venv
  that was never created. That is why `scripts/install.sh` refuses below 6 GB free.

## 2. How a model response reaches an agent (the only supported path)

```
agent (profile)
  -> config: model.base_url = http://127.0.0.1:9700/v1   (managed scope /etc/hermes/config.yaml)
  -> hermes-shim.service  (deploy/shim/aios_openai_shim.py, OpenAI-compatible, loopback)
  -> octopus-aios.service :9600   POST /api/v1/aios/ask {"goal": "..."}
  -> LLM balancer (11 providers, 5 tiers, weighted + health-gated)
```

- **FACT** The Octopus AIOS balancer has **no** OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `POST
  /v1/chat/completions` returns 404 there. Routes are `/health`, `/api/v1/aios/status`,
  `POST /api/v1/aios/ask`, `POST /api/v1/aios/execute`, `GET /api/v1/aios/tasks/{id}`,
  `POST /api/v1/aios/debate`.
- **FACT** Provider keys live **only** in the balancer's environment. No agent, profile or
  script in this repo holds a provider credential. Do not add one.
- **FACT** The shim binds 127.0.0.1 only and requires `Authorization: Bearer
  $HERMES_BALANCER_API_KEY` (from `/etc/hermes/shim.env`, 0600 root — not readable by the agent
  user, on purpose).
- **FACT** The shim rewrites the model name into a balancer *tier hint*
  (`hermes-fast|code|reason|long|local|auto`). Model names like `gpt-4o` are **not** valid here.
- **OBSERVATION** The balancer ignores the `tier` field the shim sends (`GoalRequest` has no
  `tier`; `ask_llm` does not pass one). Provider choice is always weight+health ordered.
  Do not build logic that depends on a specific tier being honoured.
- **OBSERVATION** Provider health flaps: individual providers (e.g. `gemini-gemini-2.5-flash`)
  report unhealthy for minutes at a time. The balancer routes around them; this is not an outage.

## 3. Hermes runtime layout

- **FACT** Agent OS runs as unix user `hermes`, venv `/home/hermes/.hermes-venv` (hermes-agent
  0.19.0 = current PyPI release), home `/home/hermes/.hermes`, binary
  `/home/hermes/.local/bin/hermes`.
- **FACT** A legacy Hermes install exists under `/home/ubuntu/hermes-venv` with home
  `/home/ubuntu/.hermes`. It is wired to the live liza Telegram bridge. **Do not touch it.**
- **FACT** `hermes serve` is the *desktop (Electron) backend* and exits without a packaged app.
  The headless WebUI is `hermes dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9119 --skip-build --no-open`,
  serving the dist bundled in the pip package. Unit: `hermes-serve.service`.
- **FACT** A named profile does **not** inherit `~/.hermes/config.yaml` ("config.yaml not found
  (using defaults)"). The one shared layer is the managed scope at `/etc/hermes/config.yaml`.
  Change a model setting there, not in 27 places.
- **FACT** `/etc/hermes` **must stay mode 0755**. Hermes' managed-scope loader stats
  `/etc/hermes/.env` and raises `PermissionError` instead of returning False when the directory is
  not traversable — which breaks *every* `hermes` command, kanban included. The secrets inside
  stay 0600. `hermes-env-guard.service` enforces the mode.
- **LESSON** This happened twice on 2026-09-15 (install-time 0750, then an `install -d -m 0700`).
  That is why the mode is now a checked invariant, not a convention.

## 4. Units that must be up

| unit | role | why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `hermes-env-guard.service` | restores `/etc/hermes/shim.env` and fixes the dir mode | without it a deleted secret is a full outage |
| `hermes-shim.service` | the OpenAI↔balancer translator | no shim = no agent can think |
| `hermes-serve.service` | dashboard/WebUI + JSON-RPC on 127.0.0.1:9119 | the human and Android control surface |
| `hermes-gateway.service` | hosts the embedded kanban dispatcher + cron | no gateway = tasks sit in `ready` forever |

- **LESSON** `hermes kanban daemon` is deprecated — the dispatcher lives in the gateway. Running
  both races for claims.
- **LESSON** The dispatcher spawns agent workers as its **children**. A transient unit
  (`systemd-run`) or a default cgroup kill orphans every spawned task in `running` forever with no
  error anywhere. Hence `KillMode=mixed` on the gateway.
- **FACT** INFO-level gateway lines go to `$HERMES_HOME/logs/gateway.log`, not journald. When
  something "didn't happen", read the file before assuming it did not.

## 5. The agent bus is `hermes kanban` (LOCAL layer — see §10 for the distributed layer)

> UPDATE 2026-09-16: the bus is now TWO layers. The kanban board remains the durable local
> mirror/history of every node; cross-node transport is NATS JetStream. §10 has the rules.

- **DECISION** No bespoke message bus. Hermes ships a durable SQLite board with atomic claims,
  dependencies, comments, attachments and a dispatcher daemon, shared across profiles. A second
  bus would be weaker and unloved. Board: `hermes-os`.
- **FACT** Verified end-to-end: a task was created, claimed by the dispatcher, executed by the
  `server-guardian` profile with a real shell tool call, and completed with its result on the
  board.
- **FACT** Every profile must have its own `SOUL.md` carrying the shared operating contract;
  `profile create` copies whatever exists at creation time, so `scripts/apply-agent-soul.sh` must
  be re-run after adding a profile.
- **LESSON** Without an explicit autonomy clause, a dispatched task stalls on a `clarify` call
  that nobody can answer. Observed: 120 s lost to a question the model asked itself. `clarify`
  is now removed from the tool allowlist in the managed scope, so this cannot recur.
- **FACT** Delegation is **asynchronous and one-way by default**. There is no "call agent B and
  wait for its reply" verb. A worker that ends its run has ended it. Request/reply across agents
  means: the requester creates a card for the specialist and either completes its own card
  saying what it delegated, or makes its own card depend on the specialist's
  (`hermes kanban link <specialist_id> <mine>`), which parks it in `todo` until the specialist
  finishes, then auto-promotes it.
- **LESSON** A worker cannot wait, and telling a small model to try produces a loop. A card whose
  body said "wait for/read its result" resulted in the *same* sub-task being created **16 times**,
  all running at once, all competing for the same provider quota. The fix is structural, not
  rhetorical: `hermes kanban create ... --idempotency-key <stable-slug>`. Verified — a second
  create with the same key returns the first task's id instead of creating another. Any
  delegation from an agent must carry one.
- **OBSERVATION** Concurrency is a cost control here, not just a speed knob. Four workers running
  at once exhausted the provider pool and every one of them failed; a single card, verified,
  finished. The dispatcher spawns at most one worker per 60 s tick — the storms come from agents
  fanning out, not from the dispatcher.

## 6. Hard rules for anything that writes

- **FACT** Never read, echo or commit: `/etc/hermes/shim.env`, `/etc/hermes/git-credentials`,
  `/etc/octopus/*`, `~/.hermes/.env`, `*.pem`, `~/.ssh/*`.
- **FACT** Never `git reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, `push --force` or `checkout -- .` in a project
  tree. Uncommitted files here are live work — audit found 100+ dirty paths.
- **FACT** `scripts/secret-scan.sh` must print `clean` before any commit. It runs as part of the
  install/doctor path and independently before push.
- **DECISION** Secrets are referenced by name (`${VAR}` in config, `EnvironmentFile=` in units),
  never inlined. That is what makes this repo safe to publish.

## 7. Remote access (Android / direct public port)

- **FACT** The dashboard now binds **`0.0.0.0:9119`** and is reached **directly**:
  `http://<PUBLIC_IP_REDACTED>:9119/` → password login. Owner decision 2026-09-15 (`plain_port`: no
  Tailscale on the phone, no TLS).
- **FACT** It is protected by the bundled `basic` dashboard-auth provider, enabled with
  `hermes plugins enable basic`. Credentials live in `/etc/hermes/dashboard.env` (0600 root,
  `USERNAME` / `PASSWORD_HASH` / `SECRET`) with a plaintext copy in
  `/etc/hermes/dashboard.password` (0600 root). Session TTL 43200 s = 12 h; `SECRET` is set, so a
  service restart does not invalidate live sessions.
- **FACT** Verified from the public internet on 2026-09-15 (not from loopback): 6/6 external
  probe nodes see the port open; `/` → `302 /login?next=%2F`; `/login` → `200` "Sign in — Hermes
  Agent"; `POST /auth/password-login` with the real password → `200 {"ok":true,"next":"/"}`;
  `/api/sessions` → `401` unauthenticated and `200` with the session cookie; wrong password →
  `401`. `/api/status` stays public — it is an intentional liveness probe with no secrets.
- **FACT (cost us an hour — two firewalls, and the cloud one is authoritative)** ufw is the *inner*
  firewall. OCI filters ingress at the VCN security list *before* the packet reaches the host, so a
  perfect ufw rule and an unfiltered bind still leave the port dead. The list permitted only
  22, 80, 443, 8080, 5434, ICMP; six independent external nodes confirmed everything else was
  filtered while `ufw` already said `ALLOW 9119`. Fix: `sudo bash scripts/oci-open-port.sh 9119`
  (backup + clone-the-SSH-rule + verify-no-rule-lost; the OCI API has no append — `update` replaces
  the whole ingress set, so a bad payload can lock you out). Inspect with
  `bash scripts/oci-firewall.sh inspect`.
- **FACT** The OCI CLI is at `/home/ubuntu/oci-venv/bin/oci`, region `iad`. Use
  **`/root/.oci/config`** — it belongs to this instance's tenancy. `/home/ubuntu/.oci/config` is a
  *different* tenancy and returns `NotAuthenticated` / 401 for this instance. A credential that
  authenticates fine (`oci iam region list`) can still be the wrong one for the box.
- **RISK (accepted, but real)** Transport is **plain HTTP**: the password crosses the network in
  clear text and can be captured on the path. Treat it as a low-value credential, rotate it with
  `scripts/enable-dashboard-auth.sh` if it leaks, and prefer the tunnel on untrusted networks.
  `/auth/password-login` is rate-limited per IP (429) and logs failures.
- **FACT** Rotating credentials invalidates every existing session and requires
  `sudo systemctl restart hermes-serve`.
- **FACT** You still cannot reach the dashboard by a *hostname* that is not the bound interface:
  Host validation accepts only `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` on a loopback bind, and on a
  wildcard bind the request must arrive by IP. `400 Invalid Host header` is DNS-rebinding
  protection (GHSA-ppp5-vxwm-4cf7), not a bug.
- **FACT** `tailscale serve` cannot bridge it: it preserves the incoming Host, so the dashboard
  refuses (measured: 400 via MagicDNS, 404 via IP); `--https=443` hangs (>300 s); and the tailnet
  account cannot get TLS certs (`tailscale cert → 500`). Do not spend time on it.
- **FACT** Ports 80/443 are held by the **production nginx** (`api.autosklo.org.ua`). Never bind,
  proxy or reconfigure anything on those ports.
- **DECISION** Route 2 is kept as a fallback for locked-down networks:
  `ssh -L 9119:127.0.0.1:9119 ubuntu@<TAILNET_IP_REDACTED>` then `http://127.0.0.1:9119` on the phone.
  When routing through the tunnel, use the **tailnet** IP so the SSH session itself is inside
  WireGuard.
- **LESSON** A test is only as good as its vantage point. Loopback tests passed while the service
  was unreachable from the internet, and this agent's own sandbox egress goes through an HTTP proxy
  (it "reaches" every port, including ones that are actually filtered) — so external reachability
  had to be established with third-party probe nodes, with a known-open port as a control.


## 8. Known-broken or known-open (do not re-discover, do not "fix" blind)

- **FACT** `logistics-recurring-demand-scheduler-1` container is `Exited (1)`. Pre-existing, not
  Hermes-owned. Needs an owner decision.
- **OBSERVATION** `octopus-slo-checker` fires `disk_root_lt_85_percent`; historically it was a
  real disk alert, currently green.
- **OBSERVATION** A cron entry restarts the removed `octopus-devpanel.service` every 2 minutes
  ("Unit not found"). Harmless noise, but it masks real unit failures in the log.
- **HYPOTHESIS** `/etc/hermes/shim.env` was deleted at ~13:30 on 2026-09-15 by a concurrent root
  shell (`/usr/bin/bash -s` appears in the sudo audit log in the 17-second window; no `rm` was
  logged). Not proven. The self-heal guard makes the cause non-critical, but if it recurs, treat
  it as evidence of an unmanaged automation and find it.
- **OBSERVATION** `:5434` (postgres for the logistics control plane) listens on 0.0.0.0/[::] with
  a ufw rule from any address. Pre-existing; flag it, do not change it without an owner.

## 9. Skills and the agent chat (added 2026-09-16)

- **FACT** Skills live in this repo as `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` (frontmatter `name` +
  `description`, then Why / Use / Do not / Lesson) and are loaded from there — the repo is the single
  source of truth, nothing is copied into `HERMES_HOME`.
- **FACT (cost an hour) The skill loader reads `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` ONLY.** `agent/skill_utils.py`
  resolves `skills.external_dirs` via `get_config_path()`, which is `HERMES_HOME/config.yaml`, and parses
  it directly with `_load_raw_config()`. It **never** consults the managed scope in `/etc/hermes`.
  Measured: entry present only in `/etc/hermes/config.yaml` → `hermes skills list` = **0 skills**;
  the same entry in the user config → 9 skills immediately. Consequence: this setting is runtime state,
  so it must be re-applied after any rebuild — hence `scripts/register-skills.sh` (idempotent, called by
  `install.sh` and `bootstrap.sh`) instead of a line in the managed config.
- **FACT** 9 skills are registered and enabled: `disk-gate`, `oci-cloud-firewall`, `step-status-protocol`,
  `skills-first`, `octopus-skill-catalog`, `agent-chat-rooms`, `response-format-ru`,
  `chatgpt-backend-export`, `chatgpt-ui-driver`. Verified through the agent-facing path:
  `tools.skills_tool.skills_list()` returns all nine with descriptions and `skill_view()` loads bodies.
- **FACT (budget)** Every enabled skill's `name` + `description` enters **every** system prompt.
  `hermes prompt-size`: 0 skills → 11,845 B, skills index 0 B; 9 skills → 14,279 B, index 870 B.
  The Octopus catalogue holds **243** `SKILL.md` (core 132, meta 36, swarm 34, memory 32, research 4,
  dr 2, mcp 2); importing it would add ~20+ KB and starve the balancer's prompt budget (the balancer
  truncates the assembled prompt at 4000 chars). It stays a **pointer** skill, never an import.
- **FACT** `/mnt/agents` is a **symlink to `/root/agents`** — older instructions say `/mnt/agents/...`;
  it is the same tree, not a second copy.
- **FACT** The agent chat is the kanban bus. A **room** is an unassigned task on board `agents-chat`
  (`room: <name>`, created with `--idempotency-key room-<name>` so the id is stable forever) whose
  **comments are messages**, authored by `$HERMES_PROFILE`.
- **FACT (safety invariant)** The dispatcher claims only `status='ready' AND assignee IS NOT NULL`
  (`kanban_db.py` dispatch candidate query) and no `kanban.default_assignee` fallback is configured, so
  an unassigned room is **never executed**. Verified live: the room stayed `ready (unassigned)` across a
  dispatcher tick with no runs and no gateway log entry. Assigning a room to a profile would launch that
  profile to "work" the conversation and burn quota.
- **FACT** The human side needs no new tooling: the dashboard ships a bundled **Kanban** plugin
  (`plugins/kanban/dashboard/manifest.json`, tab `/kanban`, "read comment threads, see which profile is
  running what"), mounted at `/api/plugins/kanban/` behind the ordinary dashboard session auth (the
  `/events` WebSocket takes `?token=`). Verified: `/api/plugins/kanban/boards` lists `agents-chat` and
  `/api/plugins/kanban/tasks/t_6e71b126?board=agents-chat` returns the room task — the thread is
  readable from the phone browser that already has the dashboard login.
- **FACT** Workers read rooms unaided: the worker prompt is only `work kanban task <id>` and the agent
  then calls `kanban_show`, which returns comments and events. No push channel is needed for
  agent-to-agent messages; only humans need one.
- **FACT** Human-visible push needs a messaging platform: `hermes gateway setup`, then
  `hermes send -t telegram:<chat> "…"` or per-task `notify-subscribe --platform telegram --chat-id <id>`.
  `channel_directory.json` reported `{"platforms": {}}` on 2026-09-16 — no platform is configured yet.
- **OBSERVATION (small, cost 20 minutes)** `hermes skills list` ends with a **trailing blank line**, so
  `... | tail -1` yields an empty string and any check built on it reports "could not query" on a healthy
  system. Read the summary line by content (`grep -E 'hub-installed'`). A verification that fails on
  success is worse than no verification — the same failure mode as the `backup.sh` false "verified".

## 10. Distributed Agent Bus + agents (added 2026-09-16)

**Two layers, both required.** NATS 2.10 + JetStream (`hermes.>`, stream `AGENT_BUS`, 7-day
window, file storage) is the transport: fan-out, DM, request/reply, replay for a node that
was offline. The kanban board `agents-chat` is the durable local mirror and history: one room
per channel, one comment per message, readable with no bus and shown in the dashboard's
Kanban tab.

* Subjects: `hermes.chat.<channel>.<priority>`, `hermes.dm.<agent>.<priority>`,
  `hermesrpc.rpc.<agent>` (RPC is OUTSIDE the stream — inside it, the server's PubAck answers
  the request and beats the real agent), `hermes.node.register` (a join announcement).
* Channels: general, orchestrator, server, github, security, monitoring, projects, incidents,
  knowledge. Kinds: event/decision/task/result/error/status/request/reply. Priorities:
  low/normal/high/urgent (priority rides in the subject).
* Token: `/etc/hermes/nats.env` (0600). NATS binds 0.0.0.0 but ufw allows 4222 only from
  100.64.0.0/10 (tailnet), 10.0.0.0/24 and 172.17.0.0/16 (docker nodes).
* One durable consumer per node (`node-<server_id>`) = offline replay. Ack only after the
  message is durable locally, so a dead board delays a message instead of losing it.
* Agents: `agents/runtime.py` hosts every local agent (systemd `hermes-agents`, or
  `deploy/nosystemd/ctl.sh` where systemd is absent). An agent can ONLY run handlers declared
  in `config/agents/*.yaml` → `bus.handlers`: a message names a handler, never a shell command.
  `scripts/wire-agents.sh` owns that block (idempotent; `--check` for drift). 27 agents wired.
* Routing: the orchestrator picks a target by capability, sends a task with a
  `correlation_id`, and rolls the result up when it arrives. Agents therefore talk to each
  other through one bus — there is no mesh of direct agent-to-agent links.
* Peer nodes are real: `node-arm-02` (srv-c6faaa05) and `node-arm-03` (srv-88534e5c) are
  containers that were built from GitHub by `scripts/bootstrap.sh --no-systemd`. Their agents
  are node-scoped (`node-arm-02/server-guardian`) so a role is not an identity; their role is
  persisted in `/etc/hermes/node.env`.
* Health: `hermes-bus digest` (one screen, all channels), `hermes-bus-bridge status`,
  `tests/bus-selftest.sh` (10 checks), `tests/federation-selftest.sh` (10 checks across two
  nodes), doctor gates 14-17.

### Hard rules that came out of real failures
* Never put RPC inside the JetStream subject space (PubAck hijack).
* Ack only after local durability; wrap the callback so a poison message cannot loop forever.
* A node's role belongs in a FILE (`/etc/hermes/node.env`), not in the shell that started it.
* Do not run `hermes gateway restart --system` casually: it regenerates the unit and once
  pointed it at another operator's venv (203/EXEC). The drop-in pins it; doctor gate 17 checks.
* An untested restore is a story: rehearsals must count what came back.
